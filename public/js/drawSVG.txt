It’s just fun. I enjoy getting up in the morning and working out in my head how to build a particular feature or make something work a certain way.


I guess I just really enjoy working on the frontend, on the part of the application that the end user will directly interact with in the end.

Even a newbie javascript programmer is already using both sides of their brain.
